## Introduction to Higher Order Functions
This section provides an overview of what higher-order functions are and why they are useful in Kotlin programming. Learn about the benefits of using higher-order functions and how they enable concise and expressive code.

## Passing Functions as Parameters
Discover how to pass functions as parameters to other functions, allowing for code reuse and flexibility in Kotlin. Examples demonstrate various ways to pass functions as arguments and how to invoke them within higher-order functions.

## Returning Functions as Results
Explore the concept of returning functions as results from other functions. Learn how higher-order functions can create and return functions dynamically based on certain conditions or input parameters.

## Function Types and Lambdas
Understand Kotlin's function types and lambda expressions, which are essential for working with higher-order functions. Learn how to define and use lambda expressions to create concise and readable code.
